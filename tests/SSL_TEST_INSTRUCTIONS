To run the integration and cluster tests with tls enabled, you will need to install the tcltls package. 

Regular tests do not require you to install the package.

There wasn't a lot of documentation for installation, but these commands worked for me.

===== MacOS =====
TODO: Get this working on a MacOS, which doesn't like tcltls.

===== UBUNTU =====
sudo apt-get install tcltls

===== CENT-OS =====
cd /tmp
wget https://core.tcl.tk/tcltls/uv/tcltls-1.7.16.tar.gz
tar -xvf tcltls-1.7.16.tar.gz
cd tcltls-1.7.16
./configure
cd ..
sudo cp -r tcltls-1.7.16/ /usr/share/tcl8.5/
